# GitHub Actions workflow: build (and optionally push) the Docker image
# Triggers: push to main branch and manual workflow_dispatch
#
# This workflow builds the image using Docker Buildx. If the repository
# has a valid GITHUB_TOKEN (default) the workflow will login to ghcr.io and
# will push the image for non-PR runs. You can disable pushes by running
# the workflow against a pull request or by removing GITHUB_TOKEN from
# repository secrets (not recommended).
#
# Tags produced:
# - ghcr.io/<owner>/openbsd_docker_amd64:latest  (on pushes)
# - ghcr.io/<owner>/openbsd_docker_amd64:<commit-sha>
